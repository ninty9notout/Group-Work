This plugin allow you to open .mesh files in blender,

you can really edit the file, but it's useful to be able to see which file it is

texture must be in the same directory as the .mesh file to be visible on the model

on newer versions of blend, ogre_import.py must by put in the 'plugins' folder not the root
